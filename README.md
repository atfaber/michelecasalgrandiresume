# Michele Casalgrandi's Resumé
## The Why Before The What
After a long day that started with "Federal Agents" raiding my workplace (executing a search warrant), I find myself wondering if I'll have a job tomorrow morning.
So here goes another round of resumé writing ...
You'd think I can take the latest resumé and with a few copy-paste-and-modify I'd get a brand new, cleverly-worded resumé that I can send to employers.
NOT!
The bullets are not the same size! The indents are all wrong! The line spacing is a random number!  
Well, that's because you are not privy to the secrets of 'List Indents' and 'Line and Paragraph Spacing'!
HUMBUG!
## The JSON Resumé MANIFESTO
- Enough with the infamous word processor absolute nightmare of formatting, indenting, underlining and other related time-wasters.
- Enough with the other word processors absolute nightmare of formatting, indenting, underlining and other related time-wasters.
- Employers: stop asking for a resume AND to fill some random forms asking for the same information OVER AND OVER.
- Recruiters and Employers: agree on a resumé format already and stop wasting my, yours and everybody else time.
## What
My resume is in JSON format.  That's the ground truth.
At some point in time I will write code that will generate the _desired_ document format, or not.
## FAQ (to myself)
Where is the schema? I'm thinking about it.  
I don't like the format. Write your own code to generate one.
## Resumé?
Yeah, the Curriculum Vitae, the C.V.
## The Spelling
Resume, résumé, resumé.  There you go.
## EMAIL_TOKEN?
Yeah. I almost put my actual email address.
## TODOs
- As a job candidate, I can point the resume generator to a job description and automatically populate my resumé with as many matching keywords as possible. so that the AI will return my resumé in the top 3 results.
- Same as above but without lying.
- As a job candidate, I can point the resume generator to a job description and automatically remove all the fake keywords that were added to lure candidates, so that I can send my resume only to the top 3 employers with an actual match.
